# 🧠 Skin Cancer Detection using CNN (PyTorch)

A deep learning project to classify skin lesions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch, trained on the HAM10000 dataset. This model aims to assist in early detection of skin cancer by automating image classification of various types of skin lesions.
